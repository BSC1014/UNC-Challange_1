# Kickstarter Analysis 

### Overall, the goal of the project was to deep dive Kickstarted campaigns to determine how launch dates and goals translated into overall campaign outcomes. To do this we visualized both outcomes based on campaign goals (i.e., how much funding was needed), as well as outcomes based on launch date. As Louise's analysis revolves around plays/theater, the analysis focuses on the subset of results for similar funding campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

- Not surprisingly, launch date heavily skewed overall success of similar Kickstarter campaigns. As evidenced in the chart below,  most theater successful outcomes occurred in the warmer months of the year Apr-Sept. May saw the most successful campaigns while June and July placed 2nd and 3rd. It’s important to note that the overall number of campaigns launched also increased in the warmer months, but successful outcomes were still more likely as evidenced by the differential between successful and failed outcomes during those months. Based on this data I would recommend Louise start her campaign in May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

- When looking at outcomes vs. goals, it’s important to look at overall project count. Some larger goals $25K+ saw ~50% to ~70% success rates, but there are limited overall projects in that funding range. Not surprisingly, overall, larger funding requirements correlated with higher overall failure rates. As such, I would recommend Louise stick with a smaller campaign goal if she can, ideally below $15K. This will lead to a higher chance her campaign will be successful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- Challenge 1: No regional (city level) data was available, which could skew overall theater outcomes based on launch date. To perform a more comprehensive analysis, it would be usefully to understand if cities with warmer year-round climates had a similar uptick in successful outcomes during the warmer months i.e. was the uptick mainly in cities where there were cold winters but stayed constant in warmer climates. Louise can then make a more informed decision based on her regional location.

- Challenge 2: Its somewhat obvious that smaller goals would have higher success percentages while higher goals would have higher fail rates. Considering there is not a lot of overall data on plays past $25K 42 of the overall 1,047 plays, Louise could consider looking analyzing the overall data and/or analyzing the parent category theater which would lead to a more robust data set.

## Results

- What are two conclusions yo

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
